Bruckner, Anton, b. Ansfelden, Upper Austria, Sept. 4, 1824; d. Vienna, Oct. », 1896. Organist, composer, and teacher. Son of a village schoolmaster, early orphaned, and chiefly self-taught, he became by diligent study and practice so remarkable an organist and contrapuntist as to obtain, in 1855, the appointment as cathedral organist at I inz-on-Danube, in competition with many rivals. As opportunity offered, he studied comp, with O. Kitzler, and cpt. with Sechter; in 1867 he succeeded Sechter as court - organist at Vienna, also as prof, of org., harm., and cpt. at Vienna Cons.; in 1875 he was also app. " Lektor" of music at Vienna Univ.; in 1891 the Univ. gave him the title of Dr. hon. causa. Journeys to France (1869) and England (1871) establ. his'fame as one of the greatest of contemporary organ-virtuosi. His comp.s, in which Wagner's influence is strongly felt, include 9 symphonies: ist, C min.; 2nd, C min.; 3rd, D min.; 4th (" Romantic") in E [7; 5th, B [7; Gth, A maj.; 7th (with lovely adagio), in E; 8th, C min.; gth (unfinished) ; a fine Te Deum(i886, Vienna) ; Grand Masses in D min., E min., and F min.; a Requiem, Graduals, Offertories, Psalms; " Germanenzug," f. male chorus; several other works for ditto ; chamber-music ; string-quintet in F ; etc. His music seems, in general, lacking in inspiration and individuality. —Biogr. sketch of B. by Franz Brunner (Linz-on-Danube, l8g5 ; pp. 43).
