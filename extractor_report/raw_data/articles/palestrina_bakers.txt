Palestrina, [Giovanni Pierluigi Sante, called da Palestrina,] the greatest composer of the Catholic Church and of the Roman School, was born at Palestrina, near Rome, probably 1514 or i5 I 5 ; died at Rome, Feb. 2, 1594. Born of poor parents, his early life is obscure ; it is said that he earned his living at first as a church-singer ; he was probably a pupil in CI. Goudimel's famous school in 1540, and organist at his native town 1544-51, in which year he succeeded Rosseli as magister puerorum (master of the boys) in the Cappella Giulia, with the title of "maestro della cappella della Basilica Vaticana." His first published work was a book of masses a 4, dedicated to Pope Julius III., who, recognizing his genius, caused him to be admitted to the Pontifical Chapel as a singer (a gross infraction of the rules, P. being married, and a poor singer) in Jan., 1554. Paul IV., on his accession to the Holy See, dismissed P. with a pension of 6 scudi per month (July 30, 1555) ; however, on the latter's recovery from a severe illness caused by this blow, the Pope appointed him maestro di cappella at the Lateran (Oct. 1, 1555). In 1560 his famous Improperio for Holy Week attracted such attention, that the Pope (Pius IV.) secured them for the Sistine Chapel, where they have since been performed on every Good Friday. In 1561 he exchanged his post for the better-salaried one of maestro at Santa Maria Maggiore. He remained in this church fora decade, during which his fame was firmly established. The scheme of Pope Paul IV. for the reform of church-music, laid before the Council of Trent (1545-63), had resulted in the determination by that august body to suppress all distinctly secular elements, and more particularly the canti fermi borrowed by even eminent composers from the melodies of indecent songs ; but they hesitated to adopt the more radical features in the Pope's program, especially the abolition of figurai song. During further discussion of this matter by the College of Cardinals in 1564, Palestrina was requested to write a mass which, without banishing the beauties of florid melody and polyphonic art, should be in every way appropriate for church-performance. He wrote not one, but three, of which the third, the " Missa papae Marcelli," was so wholly satisfactory that the idea of banishing polyphonic music from the church-service was definitively abandoned, and P. ("the saviour of music") was appointed composer to the Pontifical Chape], a post of honor held only by himself and Anerio. In 1571 he succeeded Animuccia as maestro of St. Peter's, an office which he retained until his death. He was also interested in Neri's "Congregazione del Oratorio" as a composer {v. Neri), taught occasionally in Nanini's school, and was maestro concertatore to Prince Buoncompagni from 1581. The desire of Pope Sixtus V. to make P. maestro of the Sistine Chapel, was frustrated by the opposition of the singers, who refused to serve under a layman. The revision of the Roman Gradual and Antiphonal, entrusted to P. by Pope Gregory XIII., remained unfinished; there were published the " Directorium chori " (15S2), the Passion songs after the 4 Evangelists (1586), the Offices óf Holy Week (1587), and the Prae-faliones (1588). On the death of his pupil and assistant, Giudetti, P. was obliged to suspend the work.—Palestrina's works mark the culmination of the era of strict simple contrapuntal composition in the Gregorian modes ; the perfection of a cappella church-music within these limits. Orlandus Lassus and Giovanni Gabrieli approach, but hardly equal him.
