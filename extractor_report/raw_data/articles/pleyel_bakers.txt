Pleyel, Ignaz Joseph, b. Ruppertsthal, n. Vienna, June 1, 1757 ; d. on his estate near Paris, Nov. 14,1831. P. remained in this congenial atmosphere until 1781, then making a brief visit to Vienna, and returning to Rome, departing for the second time, in 1781, to become 2nd Kapellm. at the Strassburg Minster. He was advanced to 1st Kapellm. in 1789 ; lost his position through the mad attacks of the Revolution on Church and State, and went to London in the winter of 1791-2 on an invitation to conduct the Professional Concerts, a rival enterprise (though P. did not know it) to his old teacher Haydn's concerts under Salomon's management. These Professional Concerts were successful in themselves, but did not overwhelm the rival enterprise ; P., after conducting them for a few years, returned to his property near Strassburg, but was subjected to such annoyances from the revolutionists that he sold his place in 1795, and went to Paris. Here he began business as a music-seller, and in 1797 founded a piano-factory, the growing prosperity of which gradually absorbed his attention, and caused him to give up composition. (The firmname is now Pleyel, Wolff & Cie. ; the 100,-oooth instrument was sold in 1889.) P. was an extremely prolific instrumental composer ; he pubi. 29 symphonies ; a septet f. strings w. 2 horns ; a sextet f. 2 violins, 2 violas, 'cello, and d.-bass ; 5 books of string-quintets ; 45 string-quartets ; 6 quartets f. flute and strings (12 more, called by Onslow the best, are still MS.) ; string-trios ; 2 violin-concertos ; 7 symphonies concertantes f. 2 violins, f. strings, f. strings and wind, f. wind, or pf. and violin ; 4 'cello-concertos ; 2 pf.-concertos, many sonatas f. pf. and violin, 6 grand sonatas f. pf. solo, sonatas f. pf. 4 hands, and other pf.-music ; etc., etc.
